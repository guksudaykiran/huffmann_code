 Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression.

 The technique works by creating a binary tree of nodes. These can be stored in a regular array, the size of which depends on the number of symbols,n.A node can be either a leaf node or an internal node. Initially, all nodes are leaf nodes, which contain the symbol itself, the weight (frequency of appearance) of the symbol and optionally, a link to a parent node which makes it easy to read the code (in reverse) starting from a leaf node. Internal nodes contain a weight, links to two child nodes and an optional link to a parent node.
 As a common convention, bit '0' represents following the left child and bit '1' represents following the right child. A finished tree has up to n leaf nodes and n-1 internal nodes. A Huffman tree that omits unused symbols produces the most optimal code lengths.
